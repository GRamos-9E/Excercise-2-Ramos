		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I have dedicated the last 3 months of my life to mastering cooking (specifically Southeast Asian cuisine). I also want to cook more meat based dishes because I do not like being healthy. If I cook a steak and offer it to you, eat it even if you have a health condition; it is worth it because steak is very expensive and it tastes delicious. I also really like cooking pasta because it is quite easy. This is why I want to pursue the course of Culinary Arts and become a chef. If I were to pick a favorite cuisine, it would be very challenging as many countries are contenders such as Italy, Philippines, China, Japan, and Thailand. If someone ever answered British cuisine, I will kick that person with my bear foot and beat them to death.</p>
